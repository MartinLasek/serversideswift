    ServerSide.swift is a framework-independent, server-side Swift conference, where we will learn and share on a number of different related topics.
    The conference is aimed at being a non-profit conference and solely run for the love of server-side Swift. This space is still new and we hope to be able to contribute to the growth of ServerSide.swift by facilitating a conference where people can meet and collaborate. We have all been following and taking part in the server-side Swift movement and after running meetups in Berlin and London, we believe that the community is ready for a conference dedicated to server-side Swift!
